1. `console.log`(); we use it to show something in console.

2. <u>variable</u>: its a container. if we want  to take  water we need glass to take it, like  that, we want to take any value we need a container and that is variable.

   

   **There are some rules to declare variable.**

   - We can't use  special character  without "_" (underscore) and $(Dollar sign).
     like. #,@,%,^,&.
   - We can't keep  space, if the variable  name contain two words.
   - If  the  variable name contain multiple word, we have to write it camel  case format.
     like. studentName.

3. If you get *undefined* output  that  means  you  don't initialize any value in this  variable. 
4. You will  get  *null* output  if  you initialize  *null*. 

#### **Lets Discuss about  some operator:**

There are five types of operator:

1. Arithmetic Operator.
2. Comparison Operator.
3. Logical Operator.
4. Conditional Operator.

- <u>**Arithmetic  Operator:**</u>   +, -, *,  /, %, this are arithmetic operator. In programming we use % to finding **Remainder***. There are another two types of operator that is ++,--.

++ means adding 1 itself and it also called increment. and -- means subtract  1 from itself and it also called decrement.

- <u>***Comparison Operator:***</u>   It  use for comparing two value. **==, !=, >, <, >=, <=**  those  are comparison operator. 

another two types  of comparison operator is === and !==.

**The difference between ==, === & != , !== is:** 

​					`var a=10;`

​					 `var b='10';`

​					`if(a==b){`
​						       `console.log('true');`

​						`}` 										

​		We declare two variable  that  is a&b,  **<u>a</u>**  contain a ***number*** type  value.  **<u>b</u>** contain ***string*** type value, but it will show  

***true***. but how? two variable convert  into one  type, than it will compare with each other. For removing  this problem here has another type operator ***===***, which i mention in above. if we write this condition  `if(a===b)` it will not execute if block because the  **===** check vale and data type also. **!=**  and **!==** is also like that.

 

- **<u>Logical Operator:</u>**   &&, ||, ! this are  logical operator. 

  Generally we  use **&&**  between two or more expression. If both expression is true than it show **true**  else  it show  **false**.

  **||** it also use  between two expression, if one expression is **true** than full expression  is **true**, and  if all expression is  **false** than full expression is  **false**.
